## Git Hiddern Folder
There is a hidder folder called `.git` which tells your that our project is a get repo.

If we wanted to created a git repo is a new project we create the folder and initialize that repo using `git init`
```sh
mkdir /workspaces/tmp/new-project
cd /worspaces/tmp/new-project
git init
touch Readme.md
code Readne.md
git status
git add . #Make changes to all files
git add Readme.md #Make changes to Readme.md only
git commit -a -m "Add readme files"
```

## Clone
You can use HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI
### HTTPS
```sh
mkdir tmp
cd /workspaces/tmp
```

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AndresMPaws/GithubDemo.git
cd GithubDemo
```

### SSH


```sh
git clone git@github.com:AndresMPaws/GithubDemo.git
cd GithubDemo
```

We will have to create our SSH rsa key pair
```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```
And copy and paste de public key in github, getting it from
```sh
cat /your_directory/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
For test our connection run
```sh
ssh -T git@github.com
```
### CLI
For installing on windows
```sh
gh repo clone AndresMPaws/GithubDemo
winget upgrade --id GitHub.cli
```

We have to login using the CLI and clone the repo
```sh
gh auth login
gh repo clone AndresMPaws/GithubDemo    
```


## Commits
When we want to commit code we can write git commit which will open up the commit edit message in editor of choice. 
Make commit and commit messages without opening an editor
```sh 
git commmit -m "Message

Set global editor
```sh 
git config --global core.editor emacs
