## Git Hiddern Folder
There is a hidder folder called `.git` which tells your that our project is a get repo.

If we wanted to created a git repo is a new project we create the folder and initialize that repo using `git init`
```sh
mkdir /workspaces/tmp/new-project
cd /worspaces/tmp/new-project
git init
touch Readme.md
code Readne.md
git status
git add . #Make changes to all files
git add Readme.md #Make changes to Readme.md only
git commit -a -m "Add readme files"
```

## Clone
You can use HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI
### HTTPS
```sh
mkdir tmp
cd /workspaces/tmp
```

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AndresMPaws/GithubDemo.git
cd GithubDemo
```

Make commit and commit messages without opening an editor
```sh
